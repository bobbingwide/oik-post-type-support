oik post type support - add page excerpts

## Description 
Add "excerpt" support to the 'page' post type. When you create page content you can write your own custom excerpt which will then be used by oik shortcodes such as [bw_pages].
If you have not written an excerpt then either your theme will auto-generate one or the system will use any text preceding the <!--more--> tag in your page content.

* Hint: When writing an excerpt use similar wording to that in your SEO meta description.

## Installation 
1. Upload the contents of the oik-post-type-support plugin to the `/wp-content/plugins/oik-post-type-support' directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Write your own excerpt for each page that requires one.
